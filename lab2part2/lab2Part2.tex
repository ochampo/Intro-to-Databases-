\section*{Problem 1}
Write a query that will return the count of elements in the Entry columns of the Alz
table .\\
\textit{soultion:}
select count(entry) from Alz;\\
3389

\section*{Problem 2}
Write a query that will return the distinct count elements in the Entry column
of the Alz table.


\textit{soultion:}
select count(distinct(entry)) from Alz;\\
3389\\

yes it is a good primary key because there is no similar values therefore it would be a good idea to make it a primary key. 

\section*{Problem 3}
Discuss: From the above two queries, is this column a good primary key for the Alz table? why or why not? (if not, then what column would you recommend, instead?)\\
\textit{soultion:}
Yes it is a good primary key because there is no similar values therefore it would be a good idea to make it a primary key. 
\section*{problem 4}
Write a query that will return the number of records associated with the organism‘‘Zea mays (Maize)’’ in the Alz and Park tables.\\
\textit{soultion:}\\
sqlite select count(entry) from Alz where Organism == "Zea mays (Maize)";\\
0\\
sqlite select count(entry) from Park where Organism == "Zea mays (Maize)";\\
9

\section*{problem 5}

\textit{soultion}
select count(a.Organism ) from Apop a ;
100082
sqlite> select count(a.Organism ) from Park a ;
127368
sqlite> select count(a.Organism ) from Alz a ;
3389

\section*{Problem 6}
\textit{soultion:}
Homo sapiens (Human)\\
Mus musculus (Mouse)\\
Rattus norvegicus (Rat)\\
Bos taurus (Bovine)\\
Pan troglodytes (Chimpanzee)\\
Danio rerio (Zebrafish) (Brachydanio rerio)\\
.....\\
 select count(distinct( p.organism)) from Park p , Alz a where p.Organism == a.Organism;
21

\section*{problem 7} 
\textit{Soultion:}
select a.entry from Apop a where a.Organism =="Bothrops brazili";\\
select a.entry from Park a where a.Organism =="Bothrops brazili";\\
C5H767\\
C5H755\\
select a.entry from Alz a where a.Organism =="Bothrops brazili";\\

It turns out the  Park table was the only one that had any matches. 
\section*{Problem 8}
 
\textit{Soultion:}
select count(distinct(p.gene\_names)) from Alz a, Park p where a.gene\_names == p.gene\_names; \\
30

\section*{Problem 9}
\textit{Soultion:}
select distinct(a.gene\_names) from Apop a, Alz al where a.Organism == al.Organism limit 10;
